# Deep Learning & Keras Demonstration

Demonstration of deep learning and Keras for those without prior knowledge.

Repository contains 3 code samples useful for teaching purposes:
1. Keras Example 1 - Basic computer vision framework (using MNIST)
2. Keras Example 2 - LSTM example for movie review sentiment classification, using GloVe word embeddings
3. Keras Example 3 - Bidirectional sequence-to-sequence model for basic neural machine translation
